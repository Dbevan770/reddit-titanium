# reddit-titanium
# Description
A front-end overlay of Reddit I created myself. Gets a JSON of the popular posts on the platform and re-renders them using my own code.

# Technologies Used
For this project I used the following Technologies:
- Vite.JS
- ReactJS
- Redux
- Typescript

# Current Features
Currently the project shows the top 24 posts retrieved from r/popular and creates a new front-end to display the information slightly more minimally.

## Future Features
- I want to add infinite scroll to whichever subreddit you are on that will continue to pull new posts as you scroll down.
- Add support for other subreddits besides popular
- Add support for reading comments underneath posts
- At the moment videos play but they are muted. This is due to reddit hosting the video with audio from their own platform. Not really sure at the moment how to adopt that to my front-end
